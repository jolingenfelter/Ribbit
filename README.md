# Ribbit

You are being given a large legacy codebase. Some of the code will be quite familiar, some less so. This is intentional as we want you to practice the very common tasks of: debugging, understanding unfamiliar code, researching documentation, and trying out new objects and frameworks.

Your job will be to fix and test all of the bugs listed below. Remember, when you fix a bug, you should not simply get rid of the issue, but address the root cause of the bug. Be sure to leave comments in your code explaining how you tracked down and fixed each bug.
